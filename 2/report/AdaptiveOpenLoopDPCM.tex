\section{Adaptive Open-Loop DPCM}
In this section we have to implement an a Differential Pulse Code Modulator. The functional scheme is presented on figure \ref{dpmc}.

The idea here is to perform a linear prediction on an input signal, and to transmit the error signal with the prediction coefficient. It is not efficient to transmit a quantized input because the frames are strongly correlated between each other, as we can see on figure \ref{corr}.
